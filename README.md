# Password-Generator

## Description

I created 4 arrays containing variables in calling out four different characters when generating a password.

Each variable was stored in another variable in order to receive the confirmation on the page.

Each confirmation is then stored in the selectedCharacters array, which is then passed back to the generatePassword function.
